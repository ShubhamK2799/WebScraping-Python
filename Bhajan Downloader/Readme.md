What I like most about python is that within a short span of time and with few lines of code we can sovle our day to day tasks very easily.
This a Hindi Bhajan Downloader that downloads all the hindi bhajans from  https://www.ibiblio.org/ram/ in python. 
I created this script when my grandfather asked me to get him all hindi bhajans and this was created.
If you are thinking to give your grandfather the same thing you are free to use it/modify it/share it.
But note that there are many songs(more than 100), and so it will take hours to download all the songs!
